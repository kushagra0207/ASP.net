SQl Interview Questions


1 - Diff between in function & SP - 
Stored Procedure SP 
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.


Declare @name int;
Set @name = 10;


CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
begin
sql_statement
end;
Execute a Stored Procedure -- EXEC procedure_name;

<----------------------------------- Parameterized Procedure ------------------>
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name(@name int, @value Varchar(255))
AS
begin
sql_statement
end;
Execute a Stored Procedure -- EXEC procedure_name;

 EXEC SelectAllCustomers 10,12;
Same way e.g.  EXEC SelectAllCustomers 'London',2;




CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30) AS SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City GO;
Execute the stored procedure above as follows: Example  - EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London';




While(Condition)
Begin
...
End  - While loop for SQL

Functions in SQL
CREATE FUNCTION add_numbers (a INT, b INT)
RETURNS INT
DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
    RETURN a + b;
END;


SELECT add_numbers(5, 10) AS result; <-- Execution part

Difference between Sp and functions
1 - Sp are precompiled object, it compiled only for 1 time and saves its compiled format and whenever it calls they exexute compiled formate.
2 - A function is compiled and executed everytime whenever it is called.

1 - We can use try catch mechanism inside sp
Begin try
..
End Try
Begin Catch
..
end Catch
2 - Cannot used inside the functions.


1 - We can use commit, rollback, begin transactions in sp(transaction and procedures)
2 - We cant use it inside the functions.


1 - return value is optional in Sp
2 - returen values is must in functions

1 - Functions can be called from procedures
2 - Procedures are not allowes to call by functions.

1 -Procedures allow select as well as DML statements(Insert / Updater / Deleete)
2 - Functions allow only select statement



View -
View is a virtual table
It is a saved query, acts as a filter on the table and reference in the view query.
like koi data bar bar chahiye hota tab ham uska use krte hai

like clipboard jaha ham data store kr lete hai aur bad me use krte hai
It not acquires any type of physical storage in the database.

aims - to maintain the security at row and columne level.


Create View view_name as [Simple Select Query] | [Join Query];
e.g create View view_name as SELECT empName, empsal, loc From employee;


View - in simple terms

ager mere pass ek query hai joh mujhe bar bar type krni pad rahi hai
kyo na me usko ek view me rakhdu taki abh me direct view ko call krke
same result display kradu


view - ek repeating query ko ek view me dalna aur usko show krna

Create View view_name AS select,name, salary from employee; // command completed successfully

-- It will be visible in the view folder.

SELECT * from view_name; // call the view_name view and execute its related query // thats why it is called as saved query
