Undeerstanding the basics of SQL

- Handling the Customers Table

UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT are most important.


1 - INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country) VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');<- Inserting In the table
2 - DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';
3 - UPDATE Customers SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt' WHERE CustomerID = 1;


BETWEEN / IN / LIKE / Top



1 - SELECT *,CustomerName as KushagraGupta, CustomerID as HIII from Customers; <- Change data suitably
2 - SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City IN (SELECT DISTINCT City FROM Customers); <- SubQuery Understanding
3 - SELECT Count(*) From (SELECT DISTINCT City From Customers);
4 - SELECT * From Customers WHERE NOT City ="Berlin";
5 - SELECT * From Customers WHERE NOT City ="Berlin" ORDER BY City;
6- SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
7 - SELECT * From Customers where country="spain" AND NOT CustomerID=8;
8 - SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%';
And have higher preference the OR so first and query will completely execute.
they divided like country spain with customer name start with G
and customername start with R, no matter with country

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE (Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%') OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%';


9 - SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE NOT CustomerName LIKE 'A%';
10 - Between or In SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 60; 
11 - SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City IN ('Paris', 'London');
12 - SELECT * from Customers WHERE CustomerID Between 10 AND 30;
13 - SELECT * From Customers WHERE Country IN ("Canada", "UK", "Mexico");
14 - SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address FROM Customers WHERE Address IS NULL;
15 - SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers; <- TOP Integer
16 - SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 3;
17 -
