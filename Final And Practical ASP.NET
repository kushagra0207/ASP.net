Final And Practical ASP.NET

Understanding ASP.NET complete and practical way

ASP.Net Provides
1 - Web Forms
2 - ASP.Net MVC
3 - ASP.NET Web pages



runat="Server" <-- Form submit at IIS

razor syntax used to display dynamically data inside html/css files.

Master Page - Footer/ Header / Navigation / Use code again and again

Create and use Css in ASP.Net
StyleSheet - file 
Style.css

PostBack - ek request hoti hai
It means sending all information from client to web server and get back to client
2 time reload hota hai

IsPostBack  - iska matlab kya page 2 bar load hua hai then true
otherwise false


Application - state is same as Session state and they both have their same syntax of declaration and use - Application{"user"] = Textbox2.value;

Session["user"] = TextBox1.value;
Application{"user"] = Textbox2.value;

In case of Session - ek browser per ager me login krta hu wahi mera session create hoga fir me dusre browser per onen krunga toh mujhe wapas se id password dena padega.

In case of Application - ager me ek bar login ho gaya toh me kisi bhi browser per jau mujhe direct access mileag apne dashboard ka no need to login again

Application State ka matlab joh bhi koi different different location se aa raha ho
usko data same milega
state same milegi
without login 


Is application ko different different log accees kr sakte hai

Grid Value Control - Repeater control - Data Control

We fetch data from the database and show in the view.

ListBox control is used to select single value and multiple value form the grid.
However, it is also used for the designing and maintaining purposes.




sender:

Type: object
Description: This parameter refers to the object that raised the event. For example, if the event was triggered by a button click, 
sender would be the button instance.

protected void btnSubmit_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // यहाँ इवेंट के लिए कोड होगा
}


e:

Type: EventArgs
Description: This parameter contains any additional information about the event. EventArgs is the base class for classes containing event data.
For most simple events, EventArgs is sufficient, but for more complex events, you might derive a class from EventArgs to provide additional data.

What is a Hidden Field?
A hidden field is an HTML <input> element with its type attribute set to "hidden".
It allows you to store data that is sent to the server when a form is submitted but is not visible to the user on the page.


What are the different types of caching?
ASP.NET has 3 kinds of caching :

Output Caching,
Fragment Caching,
Data Caching.
15. Which type if caching will be used if we want to cache the portion of a page instead of whole page?
Fragment Caching: It caches the portion of the page generated by the request. For that, we can create user controls with the below code:
<%@ OutputCache Duration="120" VaryByParam="CategoryID;SelectedID"%>


Why select Web API?
It is used to create simple, non-SOAP-based HTTP Services
It is also an easy method for creation with Web API. With WCF REST Services
It is based on HTTP and easy to define, expose and consume in a REST-ful way.
It is lightweight architecture and ideal for devices that have limited bandwidth like smartphones.
