static websites and dynamic websites
dynamic websites have user interaction and static website does not have any user interaction.

IIS - Internet Information Server Which is a server which helps to debug code and present to the UI/ screen of the user and vice versa.
basically it is for ki aap C# or VB.NET ko isme execute krke isko isi server execute krne ke bad aap browser me isko display kr sakte ho


Framework class library - FCL

Code behind mode


Every labels, checkboxes have methods, events and property
Every labels and controllers have inherited from their base class and object is created here for further use



button - properties ko change krna like color, appearacne, style and more
methods - its like operations
when I filled value with my name in google form after when I hit submit the method should clear the label / box also it should focus on the next check box
these are the types of the methods we can handle

Event like onclick ki yeh change ho jaye woh change ho jaye and all stufff

events matlab mere button click krne ke bad red color green color ban jaye and so so..


In a textbox all data are always stored in the form of string, if you want to convert it in integer you have to go with int32
Convert.ToInt32(numString);

Will work smoothly in both the two languages
C sharp and VB.NET


Runat = "server" meaning server side control hai iska
server side control

Example to use the property and change the value of a box at runtime

TextBox.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.Yellow;
TextBox.BorderStyle = BorderStyle.Solid;


Text Box Methods -

1) For Focus 
2) For Convert Text data into String

TextBox Events 

Text Changed - It will work when we change the value of text and when we change the value of text it calls.

Changing run time properties - 
TextBox1.Font.Italic = true;


TextBox1.ForeColor = System.Drawing.Color.Red;

Properties have different icons and methods have different icons

they all have different different shapes and icons


After all methods there is brackets, ();

her method ke bad (); bracket is compulsory....
TextBox2.Focus();


All proerties like color, border, width are same for all controllers

Group name matab like class in html

AdRotator banner control in ASP.NET ->  It uses XML
XML me khud ke tags ham bana sakte hai, Its simple then html
It's easy then html

Response.Redirect("Page jaha navigate krna hai"); Yeh url aur file per redirect krta hai, isme change hone ke bad url badal jayega
also
Server.Transfer("Page to show"); yeh page ko server per lata hai udha ker, isme url kabhi bhi change nhi hoga
(Home page per kisi dusri file ka data leker ana)

State Management in ASP.NET

Two types 
Cliend side
Cookies
Query string
hidden fields - use label to share data but its visibility should be 0


ViewState - 
(FOR POST Request - server se routed hoker data ana) - for this submit button per click kro kavel, no any type of get request from the server
to transfer data and show to the user first and then send to the server 
Iski speciality - page reload ho jayega tab bhi me wapas se pahele wala data bhej dunga - viewState
ViewState ko use krne ke bad chahe page kitni bar bhi load ho ham uski pahele wale data ko back la sakte hai
(take user data and store data in the variable (programming variable) and use that variable later to return back its value.

e.g - ViewState["myvalue"] = TextBox1.Text.ToString(); <- isme ham myvalue ko as a key use kr rahe hai aur value store kr rahe hai for future
TextBox1.text = ViewState["myvalue"].ToString(); <- to retrive the value by using the key
Post request ke bad hi kavel data wapas laya ja sakta hai
is wale case me sabse pahele hamne value server me dali hai fir retrive kri hai




ager me janbhuj ker url per entre kru aur wapas reload kru us case me - GET request call hogi
ViewState ki value null ho jayegi
and reset ho jayega sab kuch


Server side
Session - isme her user ke liye alag alag files banegi ki kon user kab aaya aur uski kya demands thi
Application - it is same as session and its files also store on the server but it will use only single file and all the clients information will be stored in that single file only.
Caching


Events are like page load and page unload
Postback - Post server

IsPostBack - isse ham pata laga sakte hai ki page paheli bar load ho raha hai ya submit per wapas load ho raha hai
IsPostBack == true tabhi hoga jab form 2 bar load hoga(Submit hoga)
1 bar load hone per iski value false rahegi


QueryString - Client side state management process

Response.Redirect("WebForm2.aspx?myname=" + value); <- to send the query string - myname acts as a passkey
Request.QueryString["passkey"]; <- At the receiving end
