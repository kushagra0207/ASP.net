static websites and dynamic websites
dynamic websites have user interaction and static website does not have any user interaction.

IIS - Internet Information Server Which is a server which helps to debug code and present to the UI/ screen of the user and vice versa.
basically it is for ki aap C# or VB.NET ko isme execute krke isko isi server execute krne ke bad aap browser me isko display kr sakte ho


Framework class library - FCL

Code behind mode


Every labels, checkboxes have methods, events and property
Every labels and controllers have inherited from their base class and object is created here for further use



button - properties ko change krna like color, appearacne, style and more
methods - its like operations
when I filled value with my name in google form after when I hit submit the method should clear the label / box also it should focus on the next check box
these are the types of the methods we can handle

Event like onclick ki yeh change ho jaye woh change ho jaye and all stufff

events matlab mere button click krne ke bad red color green color ban jaye and so so..


In a textbox all data are always stored in the form of string, if you want to convert it in integer you have to go with int32
Convert.ToInt32(numString);

or .ToString(); method
or Integer.parse method 

Will work smoothly in both the two languages
C sharp and VB.NET


Runat = "server" meaning server side control hai iska
server side control

Example to use the property and change the value of a box at runtime

TextBox.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.Yellow;
TextBox.BorderStyle = BorderStyle.Solid;


Text Box Methods -

1) For Focus 
2) For Convert Text data into String

TextBox Events 

Text Changed - It will work when we change the value of text and when we change the value of text it calls.

Changing run time properties - 
TextBox1.Font.Italic = true;


TextBox1.ForeColor = System.Drawing.Color.Red;

Properties have different icons and methods have different icons

they all have different different shapes and icons


After all methods there is brackets, ();

her method ke bad (); bracket is compulsory....
TextBox2.Focus();


All proerties like color, border, width are same for all controllers

Group name matab like class in html

AdRotator banner control in ASP.NET ->  It uses XML
XML me khud ke tags ham bana sakte hai, Its simple then html
It's easy then html

Response.Redirect("Page jaha navigate krna hai"); Yeh url aur file per redirect krta hai, isme change hone ke bad url badal jayega
also
Server.Transfer("Page to show"); yeh page ko server per lata hai udha ker, isme url kabhi bhi change nhi hoga
(Home page per kisi dusri file ka data leker ana)

State Management in ASP.NET

Two types 
Cliend side
Cookies
Query string
hidden fields - use label to share data but its visibility should be 0
ViewState


ViewState - 
(FOR POST Request - server se routed hoker data ana) - for this submit button per click kro kavel, no any type of get request from the server
to transfer data and show to the user first and then send to the server 
Iski speciality - page reload ho jayega tab bhi me wapas se pahele wala data bhej dunga - viewState
ViewState ko use krne ke bad chahe page kitni bar bhi load ho ham uski pahele wale data ko back la sakte hai
(take user data and store data in the variable (programming variable) and use that variable later to return back its value.

e.g - ViewState["myvalue"] = TextBox1.Text.ToString(); <- isme ham myvalue ko as a key use kr rahe hai aur value store kr rahe hai for future
TextBox1.text = ViewState["myvalue"].ToString(); <- to retrive the value by using the key
Post request ke bad hi kavel data wapas laya ja sakta hai
is wale case me sabse pahele hamne value server me dali hai fir retrive kri hai

Performance: Performance is not good if we use a large amount of data 
because View State is stored in the page itself and storing a large value can cause the page to be slow.
It reserve the value in the postback request.

Detecting ViewState Tampering
To ensure that the ViewState has not been tampered with, ASP.NET provides a built-in mechanism using ViewState 
MAC (Message Authentication Code). Hereâ€™s how you can detect and prevent tampering:

ViewState MAC: By default, ViewState is protected with a MAC. 
This ensures that any tampering with the ViewState data will be detected when the data is posted back to the server. 
If the MAC does not match, ASP.NET throws an exception.






ager me janbhuj ker url per entre kru aur wapas reload kru us case me - GET request call hogi
ViewState ki value null ho jayegi
and reset ho jayega sab kuch


Server side
Session - isme her user ke liye alag alag files banegi ki kon user kab aaya aur uski kya demands thi
Application - it is same as session and its files also store on the server but it will use only single file and all the clients information will be stored in that single file only.
Caching


Events are like page load and page unload
Postback - Post server

IsPostBack - isse ham pata laga sakte hai ki page paheli bar load ho raha hai ya submit per wapas load ho raha hai
IsPostBack == true tabhi hoga jab form 2 bar load hoga(Submit hoga)
1 bar load hone per iski value false rahegi


QueryString - Client side state management process

Response.Redirect("WebForm2.aspx?myname=" + value); <- to send the query string - myname acts as a passkey
Request.QueryString["passkey"]; <- At the receiving end


Session State in ASP.Net

if(userpassword==correct){
Session["username"] = TextBox1.Text.ToString(); // creating a user session
Response.Redirect("Welcome.aspx"); // after successful password checked we proceed with the redirect to resources.

}
<- creating a session for the user
Session["username"] = TextBox1.Text.ToString();
e.g Session["username"] = "Kushagra Gupta";


Ager koi jabardati resource ke page ko direct access krta hai

paheli line will be
if(Session["username"==null]){  Response.Redirect("login.aspx");}
else{
procees...



For Destroy a session - When user clicks on logout button
Session.Abandon(); Method 
Response.Redirect("login.aspx"); // redirect back to login again


We can also pass session.Timeout() to destroy session for a period of time - 20 min or 10 min
after that time session destroys automatically
For this process, change the activity in Web.config() file
<sessionState timeout="2"></sessionState> -  iske bad 2 min me logout ho jayega




Application State Management - It is same to the session state
But it makes only 1 file and all user information will store in that file only whereas session storeage will create multiple different different files
based on the number of users.

Use - ki  kitni bar is page ko open kra gaya hai
use case me


Yeh complete application ko kitne loggo ne access kra hai uski info bhi rakhta hai
Application State her user ke liye 1 hi hoga


example like = mere resume ko kitni bar open kra gaya


Form Validation
Check data before submitting in the sql server

Client Side Validatir
1 - Required Field validator
2 - Range field validator
3 - Compare validator - Entre your password and retype of your password
4 - Regular Expressions to validate
5 - Custom Validator - server side validator - khud ka message


Methods - Control to validate - kisko check krna hai kisko validate krna hai\
ager woh galat data enter krta hai to kya message bhejna hai


View: Rendered through controller actions (e.g., return View()).
Partial View: Rendered within other views using helper methods (e.g., Html.Partial()).

Part of View is called Partial View


MVC Filter

Client -> Route -> Controller -> Filter/Middlewware -> Action -> Middleware/filter -> View

Before action method we have filters 
1 - Authentication
2 - Authorization


After action method and before view
1 - Exception and error handlinng
2 - Result and page rendering


what is connection pooling
Connection to a databasse in expensuive
Connection pooling is a technique used to manage database connections efficiently in a high-performance application. 
It involves maintaining a pool of active database connections that can be reused by different parts of the application,
instead of creating and closing a new connection every time a database operation is performed. 
This reduces the overhead associated with opening and closing connections, thereby improving the performance and scalability of the application.
Connections are always created in the starting of the application

Connection object pool maintained the starting connection and let the already existed connection reuse again and again
it also maintains that no new connection will be created

Initialization: When the application starts, a pool of database connections is created and maintained in memory.
Request for Connection: When an application needs to perform a database operation, it requests a connection from the pool.
Reuse Connection: If a connection is available in the pool, it is reused for the new operation. If no connection is available, a new one is created and added to the pool.
Release Connection: After the operation is completed, the connection is returned to the pool rather than being closed.
Management: The pool manager handles the creation, reuse, and destruction of connections based on configurable parameters like the maximum number of connections, idle timeout, etc.



Most Imp part of ASP.Net - Part of ADO.NET
DataSet - 
When we create a website and connect it with the Database, these three plays an important role
It is like mini database which have fast cache and responds fastly
A DataSet is an in-memory representation of data that provides a consistent relational programming model regardless of the data source. It can hold multiple tables and relationships between them.
Can hold multiple tables (like a mini-database).
Supports relations between tables.
Supports constraints like primary keys and foreign keys.
Can be serialized to XML for storage or transfer.


DataSet - 
It takes/fetch data from the data from the data source or database
and
DataAdapter - A DataAdapter acts as a bridge between a DataSet and a data source for retrieving and saving data. It uses commands to retrieve data from the database and populate the DataSet
DataReader - 
 A DataReader provides a way of reading a forward-only stream of data rows from a data source. It is efficient for reading data but does not support updating or navigation.

Use Case: DataReader is used when you need to quickly and efficiently read data in a forward-only, read-only manner.

Features:

Provides fast, forward-only, read-only access to data.
Uses less memory compared to DataSet since it doesn't store data in memory.
Typically used with the ExecuteReader method of a SqlCommand object.


Difference between Web API and WCF?
WCF - Windows Communication Foundation - for creating rest services
lot of configuration is needed to turn a WCF service into a REST Service. and specially it takes lot of configuration for soap then more in rest

WCF is good for Message queue, duplex communication, end to end message security, one way messaging.
It works on lt of protocol like TCP/IP/Http/Https
WEB APi is already designed for rest services.
