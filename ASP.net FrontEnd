ASP stands for Active Server Pages

ASP is a development framework for building web pages. ASP and ASP.NET are server side technologies. 
ASP.NET pages have the extension .aspx

ASP.NET Web Pages is an SPA application model (Single Page Application).

State Management in Asp.net through HTTP protocol

Caching - fast memory aur iska main kam yeh hai ki jab koi common css ya common component ho uske

Those component which are reused again and again are stored in cache memory through process of caching

framework contains a large number of class libraries known as Framework Class Library (FCL).
The software programs written in .NET are executed in the execution environment,
which is called CLR (Common Language Runtime). 
These are the core and essential parts of the .NET framework.



CLR (Common Language Runtime)
It is a program execution engine that loads and executes the program. 
It converts the program into native code. 
It acts as an interface between the framework and operating system. 
It does exception handling, memory management, and garbage collection. 
Moreover, it provides security, type-safety, interoperability, and portablility. A list of CLR components are given below:


ADO.NET
ADO.NET is a module of .Net Framework, which is used to establish a connection between application and data sources. 
Data sources can be such as SQL Server and XML. 
ADO .NET consists of classes that can be used to connect, retrieve, insert, and delete data.
ADO.NET handels mainly database.


LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
It is a query language, introduced in .NET 3.5 framework. It is used to make the query for data sources with C# or Visual Basics programming languages.


CLS - Common Language Specification
It is a set of rules and restrictions which every language must have to follow under the .NET Framwork.
1- Dont Use Case Sensitive and casing matlab aap not casesensitive ko follow kro

2- Dont Use Pointers 

3 - Only CLS-compliant primitive types should be exposed. For example, int, float, double, and string are CLS-compliant types.


CTS - Common type system - guidelines for declaring, using, and managing data types at runtime. 

JIT is a part of CLR. It executes all programming language who supports .NET framework.
It is responsible to convert MicroSoft Intermediate language code to native code.

MSIL includes - MSIL converts source code to MSIL and then MSIL code to native code.
MSIL consist instructions for memory access, exceptional handling and many more.
It is cpu independent platform .

MSIL Is a set of instructions that are generated by specific language compiler from the source code.



State Management in ASP.NET

All Webapplications are state less.
State Management mainatiains and stores the information of the user till the user session ends.
Client Side State Management And Server Side State Manageent


Client-Side - directly client side using - client side storage
Cookies 
Viewstate
Control state
Query String
Hidden Field 


Server-Side - information stored in memory - service reply
Session
Application
Cache


What is Assembly and what are its types??

An assembly is a collection of types and resources that are built to work together and form a logical unit of functionality.
Assemblies take the form of executable (.exe) or dynamic link library (. dll) files, and are the building blocks of . NET applications

main function - .exe and main files - collection of code
dll - dynamic link library  - collection of classes and methods

They provides CLR - common language Runtime

Implemented in .exe or .dll
they are loaded into the memory when needed.

GAC - Global Assembly caches shares the Assemblies between the application.

Types of Assemblies - 
Private - Seperate assembly copy
public - need not to be copy, They have already public key and it is known as shared assembly
Satellite - used for deployment of culture and language specific resources
You can create 1 webpage in different language this is called satellite assembly langugae.


What is Caching and types of caching?
Caching is a mechanism that stores frequently accessed data in memory so that when the same data is needed another time, 
it can be directly obtained from the memory instead of the database. 
This facilitates high page response time by reducing the time it takes to render the page.
 a storage location used to temporarily store data used by servers, apps, and browsers to speed load times

InMemory Caching and Distributed Caching
In-memory caching uses server memory to store cached data. 
This type of caching is suitable for a single server or multiple servers using session affinity.
Session affinity is also known as sticky sessions. 
Session affinity means that the requests from a client are always routed to the same server for processing.

Distributed Cache
Use a distributed cache to store data when the app is hosted in a cloud or server farm.
The cache is shared across the servers that process requests. 
A client can submit a request that's handled by any server in the group if cached data for the client is available. 
ASP.NET Core works with SQL Server, Redis, and NCache distributed caches.


what is mvc in asp.net
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an application into three main components: 
the model, the view, and the controller. The ASP.NET MVC framework provides an alternative to the ASP.NET
Web Forms pattern for creating MVC-based Web applications.


Diffrence between View and Partial  in asp.net


What is a garbage collector in C#?
GC (Garbage collector) makes a trip to the heap and collects all objects that are no longer used by the application and then makes them free from memory.


Does ViewState affect performance?
How can you detect if a viewstate has been tampered?


Authentication Filter
Authorization Filter
Action filter Attribute class
Result Filter
Exceptional Filter


Which class is used to create custom filters
 the class used to create custom filters is the ActionFilterAttribute class. 


What is Collections in .NET
Collection types represent different ways to collect data, such as hash tables, queues, stacks, bags, dictionaries, and lists.
They are used to store, manipulate and retrieve aggregate data. 
We will distinguish collections in the following ways: Linear (arrays, lists, stacks, queues) Hierarchical (various kinds of trees)

Non-generic collections
Every element in the non-generic collection is stored as a System.Object type.(System.Collections)
ArrayList, Stack, Queue, HashTable, and so on.

Generic General structure defined by user
These are defined in System.Collections.Generic namespace.
Examples
Generic list, generic queue, and so on. They are template-based versions of their counterparts.


Features of ADO.NET 
ADO.NET has many features associated with it. Some of them are-

_ The applications that are built using ADO.NET can be modeled in separate layers. And this makes the code and application maintainable. 
 
The data architecture is scalable as it uses only disconnected data on the server, and since everything is handled on the client side, performance is enhanced. 
And this also increases scalability.
 
Data is transferred from one data source to another, represented internally in XML format. And this makes the interoperability of data possible.
 
_ ADO.NET supports access to many database systems, such as SQL and Oracle. And this helps users to work with different databases consistently.
 
_ ADO.NET also allows users to work with database transactions and ensures data integrity and consistency. ADO.NET supports both local and distributed transactions.
 
The programming style of ADO.NET is straightforward. In ADO.NET programs, user-defined words are used to construct statements or to evaluate expressions.


Passing of data from controller to view using ViewData and ViewBag

ViewData - Stores as Key and Value 
We can pass Key in my Programming aspx and use it with the following key in the index.html page

Page LifeCycle of ASP.NET
Page Request 
Page Start - Request and Response are created
Page Initialization - textbox and checkbox initialization - all page controls initialization
Page load - Page is load with default values and behaviours like textbox have default name and others
validation check - All validator like required and form fill will takes place. make sure non of the box will remains empty check kro ki sab kuch fill hai ki nhi
check form values and if they are wrong they will show error message and if they7 are correct they send data for the next process

Page Event Handling - 
(handling of postback event) it will trigerred when same page is loading again after clicking on the submit button

render -  compilation of page, useer ko samaj aye page ke bare me
Unbound - free from the message like unwanted object

User Controls Examples / Custom Control Example is same 
like ki apne ek component bana liya abh use here page me add krdo ya like
header aur footer ki tarah use use krlo
component ek but use hoga her jagah
