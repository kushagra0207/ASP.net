MS SQL SERVER is same as SQL Server

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);

SQL Server <-- It is a software, developed by Microsoft, which is implemented from the specification of RDBMS.
Use of SQL <---- To generate reports through SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS).

For restoring back database - Restore database Testdb from disk = 'D:\Backup\Testdb_full_backup.bak'

Instance of SQL Server
An instance is an installation of SQL Server.
An instance is an exact copy of the same software.
If we install 'n' times, then 'n' instances will be created.

Creation of Instances is due to, 
For utilization of ram and time resources and many more...
for specific resources alsp
reduce cost
To maintain production, development, and test environments separately.


SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is a tool that helps you manage and interact with Microsoft SQL Server, a type of database.
Think of it like a control panel for your database. Here's a simple way to understand it:

ek control panel se ham
security
authentication
wuery execution 
sab kuch kr sakte hai just like command prompt in windows


1 - Create Database db;
2 - Drop Database db;
3 - Restore Database db from disk ....;
4 - use db;
5 - Backup database <Your database name> to disk = '<Backup file location + file name>';
6 - Backup database TestDB to disk = 'D:\TestDB_Full.bak'
7 - Restore database <Your database name> from disk = '<Backup file location + file name>'
8 - Create user <username> for login <loginname> <-- allowing user to access database and can login successful
9 - Use <database name> Grant <permission name> on <object name> to <username\principle>

T SQL Tutorial

Provide a set of tools for the development of transactional database
T SQL - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmqC5PuzGhs&list=PLysly0KYnAY08stX1R_xDayz-jlALgfAg&index=35


T-SQL expands the SQL to include procedural programming, local variables, string processing, data processing, and mathematics.

1 - Int
2 - Float
3 - Char
4 - varchar(255)


USES Python Like statements

1 - IF
    PRINT('Hello ');

    ELSE
     PRINT('nellow ');

Indices are the unique tables that the database search engine uses to speed up the data retrieval. 
The index is a type of indicator for the data in the table. The index in a database is the same like an index at the end of the book.


GETDATE()  <-- For Getting the date from the server

DECLARE @name varchar(255); <---- Daclaration of variable
SET @name = 18;    <--- Setting values

SET @name += 10; OR SET @name = @name  + 10;

Batch in sql is a group of 2 or more SQL Statements or 1 group of sql statements.


BEGIN
{Code Blocks}

END


WHILE


TRY  - CATCH



CREATE FUNCTION FUNCTION_NAME( parameter datatype){


returns ..;
}
BEGINS

END




Triggers
A trigger is a type of stored procedure
that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server.



MS SQL -

MERGE - It combines the sequence of conditional insert, update and delete statements in the single table.



Noncluctered index it is like notebook index


View -
View is a virtual table
It is a saved query, acts as a filter on the table and reference in the view query.
like koi data bar bar chahiye hota tab ham uska use krte hai

like clipboard jaha ham data store kr lete hai aur bad me use krte hai
It not acquires any type of physical storage in the database.

aims - to maintain the security at row and columne level.


Create View view_name as [Simple Select Query] | [Join Query];
e.g create View view_name as SELECT empName, empsal, loc From employee;


View - in simple terms

ager mere pass ek query hai joh mujhe bar bar type krni pad rahi hai
kyo na me usko ek view me rakhdu taki abh me direct view ko call krke
same result display kradu


view - ek repeating query ko ek view me dalna aur usko show krna

Create View view_name AS select,name, salary from employee; // command completed successfully

-- It will be visible in the view folder.

SELECT * from view_name; // call the view_name view and execute its related query // thats why it is called as saved query
