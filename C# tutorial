Console.ReadLine() for reading the input
- The Console.ReadLine() method returns a string. Therefore, you cannot get information from another data type, such as int.
- int age = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());


We use base in case of C# and use super in case of java.

using System;

public class BaseClass
{
    public BaseClass(int number)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"BaseClass constructor called with number: {number}");
    }
}

public class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public DerivedClass(int number, string text) : base(number)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"DerivedClass constructor called with text: {text}");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        DerivedClass derived = new DerivedClass(42, "Hello, World!");
    }
}


Invoking and passing value through method with base class example
- base is same as super in C#.
